# AMLwtGNN: Anti-Money Laundering Detection with Graph Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on **Money Laundering Detection** using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. The aim is to identify suspicious financial transactions potentially related to money laundering it specifically targets the detection of suspicious transactions at the **layering stage** of money laundering activities. It processes transactional data, applies graph-based modeling, and uses advanced **machine learning techniques** to detect illicit patterns in collaboration with Dmitry Pavlyuk, Igor Rodin, and Deloitte, Latvia.  

This repository supports multiple GNN architectures (**GCN**, **GAT**, and **GraphNN**) and handles imbalanced datasets with techniques like **SMOTE**, **ADASYN**, and **upsampling**. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided to analyze the results.

## Objectives
- To detect suspicious transactions potentially related to **money laundering** activities using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

   git clone https://github.com/AliTurkarslan/Anti-Money-Laundering-AML-Transaction-Level-Models.git
2. Install the required libraries.
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Check the environment setup:

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project focuses on transactional data designed to simulate patterns indicative of **money laundering**.  
This dataset does not represent actual financial data but serves as a synthetic approximation for research purposes.
**Not Included**: The dataset is too large to be included in this repository.  
**Download Instructions**: See `data/README.md` for detailed download instructions.

## Configuration
Modify settings in **scripts/config.py** for customization.

### Model Settings
MODEL_TYPE = "GAT" # Options:  
                              # "GCN" (Graph Convolutional Network) - Focuses on general graph structures.  
                              # "GAT" (Graph Attention Network) - Adds attention mechanisms for improved feature learning.  
                              # "GraphNN" (General Graph Neural Network) - Suitable for more flexible node relationships.  
                              # These models are designed to **detect patterns and anomalies** in transaction data and are not intended for building full AML compliance systems.  

HIDDEN_DIM = 32     # Number of hidden units in each layer.
                    # Higher values may improve performance but increase computational cost.
                    # Suggested range: 16â€“128 based on dataset size.

OUTPUT_DIM = 1      # Number of output features.
                    # Typically set to 1 for binary classification problems.

EPOCHS = 20         # Number of times the model trains over the entire dataset.
                    # Increase for better learning but watch for overfitting.

LEARNING_RATE = 0.001  # Controls the step size for gradient descent.
                       # Lower values (e.g., 0.001) lead to slower but more stable training.
                       # Higher values (e.g., 0.01) speed up training but risk overshooting.

DROPOUT_RATE = 0.3  # Percentage of neurons dropped during training to prevent overfitting.
                    # Typical values: 0.2â€“0.5. Higher values increase regularization.

#### Data Balancing Settings
BALANCE_DATA = True  # Enables dataset balancing for handling class imbalance.
                     # Set to False if the dataset is already balanced.

BALANCE_METHOD = "upsampling"  # Options:
                               # 'upsampling' - Replicates minority class samples.
                               # 'smote' - Generates synthetic samples using SMOTE algorithm.
                               # 'adasyn' - Generates synthetic samples with ADASYN algorithm.
                               # Use 'smote' or 'adasyn' for non-linear data distributions.

## Hyperparameter Optimization (Optional)
This repository includes an example script (`optuna_tuning.py`) for hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.
#### Key Features
Supports tuning for model type, hidden dimensions, learning rate, and dropout rate.
Designed to maximize AUC scores by testing multiple configurations.
#### Note
Due to hardware limitations, this script has not been tested on large datasets but is included as a starting point for further development in GPU-supported environments.
